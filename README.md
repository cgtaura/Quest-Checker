For this to work you need to have sidequest downloaded and your quest headset connected to your computer. From there run the exe and click through it and it will run a deepcheck for every possiable cheat on a quest headset.

To start the check make sure that there environmentel variable path is set to one of the system 32 options then you can begin the check. Once they open the file make sure that in the top left corner there is only one headset connect to there computer. Then go through the sections of the deep check to make sure they are not on any illegal settings. If it's blank on parts such as predictions thats okay but if there is a number in any of thoughs sections it means there on illegal settings. This applys to most illegal settings except for mtp which if turned on will be displayed as mtp.
