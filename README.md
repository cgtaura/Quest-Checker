What you need to deepcheck:
For this to work you need to have sidequest downloaded and your quest headset connected to your computer. From there run the exe and click through it and it will run a deepcheck for every possiable cheat on a quest headset.

How to deepcheck:
To start the check make sure that there environmentel variable path is set to one of the system 32 options then you can begin the check. Once they open the file make sure that in the top left corner there is only one headset connect to there computer. Then go through the sections of the deep check to make sure they are not on any illegal settings. If it's blank on parts such as predictions thats okay but if there is a number in any of thoughs sections it means there on illegal settings. This applys to most illegal settings except for mtp which if turned on will be displayed as mtp.

Why i made it:
The reason i made this is that i hated the cgt and gtc mods gatekeeping quest checks just for them to only use them during the final stages of the bracket at the end of a season. So i built an app that uses the same checks they use but you can now deep check anyone at anytime. For your league or to deep check somone after an officail in cgt, gtc and the up and coming league pgt. I hope this will be of use to the whole gorilla tag comp community.
